## Feedback about this boot-camp last year

--

## Last year’s apprentices liked…

+ Realising they were already doing OOP
+ The challenge of the practical exercises
+ Having valuable mentors to support during them
+ Pace was suitable
+ Regular breaks helped to refocus
+ Us using diagrams and drawings to aid explanations
+ Good & patient explanation
+ Relevant code examples
+ Us showing a working solution for exercises

--

## They said it would be better if

+ There was more theory and depth with each process
+ Easier to start exercises when previous is incomplete
+ We explained what the code does using comments
+ Exercises were broken down into smaller steps
+ We talked through the exercise before attempting it and were more directive
+ We sent you the material in advance
+ There were clearer instructions for the exercises
+ Their understanding of coding was better
+ The boot camp was longer / there was more time
+ It was easier to get the C# code set up
